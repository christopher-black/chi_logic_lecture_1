# Logic Lecture

The goal of this lecture is to present a series of 'mini-challenges' to students. It gives them an opportunity to solve smaller
scale problems in a series of small steps. The end result is a toy application that was built in steps.

###Instructor Steps
Look at the steps below. Read the step out loud. Give students 2-5 mins at each step to solve it on their own. Make sure
to keep the room quiet for those who are concentrating on the step, but encourage people to ask questions. After people have
a couple minutes for each step, ask the them who may have an answer. No matter what the solution, positively encourage whoever
presents their solution. Then present your solution. Repeat until the application (steps) are complete. 

At the end of the steps, reinforce that the students were able to build an application when the steps were broken down for them.
Wrap up with encouraging students to break down application challenges into small logical components. Test those components, 
then move onto the next. 

### Steps
- Create a div with a 'container' class using jQuery.
- Create a button inside the container Div. 
- Console.log something when click the button.
- Track how many times you click the button and now console.log that.
- Every time you click the button 3 times, append a P tag that reads 'sushi'.
- Now wrap the Sushi P tag inside of a Div with the class of 'sushi'. 
- When clicking on the Sushi Div, delete that Div (and its contents) and console.log "Yum".
- Create a 'Hunger' variable and set it equal to 100. Every time you delete a Sushi Div, subtract 5 hunger.
- Make it so you can only eat Sushi if hunger is above zero.
